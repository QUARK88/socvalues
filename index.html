<h2>What is CapValues ?</h2>
    <p>Uuuh, guess there will be a description here soon.</p>

<h2>What are the 24 values ?</h2>
    <p>There are 12 independent axes - Social, Economic, State and Nation - and each has two opposing values assigned to them :</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ffc000;">Free Market</b> ( Economic )<br/>
        Those with higher free market scores favour less state intervention in the economy, believing that there is no need for business affairs to be complicated by government regulations. They favour market solutions, privatisation of services, market deregulation, lower taxation, etc.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#a05000;">Corporatism</b> ( Economic )<br/>
        Those with higher corporatist scores favour state intervention in the economy and are skeptical of the free market system. While still supporting the propertarian and hierarchical element of capitalism, they advocate for the organization of society in different areas of employment called "corporations" which the government assigns people to and your employment into these is designated by your interests and skills.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#50c075;">Futurism</b> ( Social )<br/>
        Those with higher futurist scores tend to be more skeptical of inherited traditions and institutions, trying to accelerate culturally as much as possible. They tend to be in favour of youth rights, free love, cultural revolutionary sentiments and completely rebrand culture (as in arts and music) getting rid of traditional schemes and focusing on a new futurist style.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#5000c0;">Conservative</b> ( Social )<br/>
        Those with higher conservative scores tend to be in favour of the preservation of inherited traditions and institutions, while slowing down cultural progress. They tend to be in favour of the traditional family unit and tend to not support sexual promiscuity or modernism. They often tend to criticize modern art and architecture.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#757575;">Autocracy</b> ( Political )<br/>
        Those with higher autocracy scores tend to prefer the judgement of the government (especially under an absolute monarchy or a technocracy, though not necessarily). They tend to be more authoritarian though not necessarily as a libertarian could support it as a better way to preserve individual freedom than traditional democracy.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00c0a0;">Democracy</b> ( Political )<br/>
        Those with higher democracy scores tend to prefer the judgement of the people. Those with higher scores may advocate for a direct democracy or a liquid democracy, while those with lower scores may just advocate for a representative democracy.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#0075ff;">Authoritarian</b> ( State )<br/>
        Those with higher authoritarian scores tend to support Law & Order, a stronger State that can act more effectively and more control over people's lives. Those with very high scores may support censorship and totalitarianism.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ffff00;">Libertarian</b> ( State )<br/>
        Those with higher libertarian scores tend to support privacy, the legalization of drugs, weaker State power and less State control over people's lives. Those with very high scores may support anarchism.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#50c000;">Environment</b> ( Industry )<br/>
        Those with higher environmentalist scores hold that nature should be a significant factor in deciding public policy, be it increasing recycling, decreasing CO2 emissions, or stopping water pollution, etc. They may support government and community regulations to protect the environment.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ffa000;">Productivism</b> ( Industry )<br/>
        Those with higher productivist scores take a more anthropocentric approach that production is superior to the environment, and humans should be able to farm and shape it as they see fit. Though not always, they tend to be skeptic of climate science.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#c0c0c0;">Land Rights</b> ( Land )<br/>
        Those with higher land rights scores hold that landlords provide a valuable service to their communities, and that private ownership of land should be held sacred and not excessively taxed.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#c0e000;">Georgism</b> ( Land )<br/>
        Those with higher georgist scores support  a fair distribution of economic rent and the annihilation of deadweight loss from inefficient taxes and harmful monopolies. They often support a Land Value Tax.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#c02500;">Anti Clerical</b> ( Religion )<br/>
        Those with higher anti clerical scores tend to support lower religious interference in public life, especially in politics. They want to end what they call unfair privileges by the religious class. Those with very high anti-clerical scores may support anti-theism.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#c000ff;">Religious</b> ( Religion )<br/>
        Those with higher religious scores tend to support religious traditions and morality, believing it should be a bulwark for civilization. They tend to support a priesthood (religious upper class) and those with very high scores could support a theocracy where religion has a high influence over public life.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00e0ff;">Globalism</b> ( Nation )<br/>
        Those with higher globalist scores tend to support global co-operation, lower restrictions to immigration and tend to view patriotism as an overrated quality. They tend to view nationalism as a divisive force that impedes progress and that meaningful goals can be only achieved with a more global world. Those with higher scores may support an United World Government.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#e07500;">Nationalism</b> ( Nation )<br/>
        Those with higher nationalist scores tend to support national pride, higher restrictions to immigration and they tend to view their Nation as a higher . They are also known for taking a ''Country First'' approach on foreign policy, as opposed to the ''United World'' approach of Internationalists. They view national sovereignty as a sacred concept.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ff7575;">Interventionism</b> ( Intervention )<br/>
        Those with higher interventionist scores tend to support foreign interventions and alliances, mostly to further Nation's interests, though some interventionists tend to justify their beliefs in a more humanitarian, internationalist-minded approach.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#2575e0;">Isolationism</b> ( Intervention )<br/>
        Those with higher isolationist scores are more skeptical of foreign interventions and alliances, either because of being skeptical of war as a whole or viewing them as a waste of time preferring to focus on internal affairs; or both.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#5000e0;">Accelerationism</b> ( Science )<br/>
        Those with higher accelerationist scores tend to support technological development, viewing it as a great way to enhance the human species. Those with higher scores could support transhumanism or posthumanism.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#c0c000;">Decelerationism</b> ( Science )<br/>
        Those with higher decelerationist scores tend to support technological deceleration, viewing it as dangerous for the human species. Those with higher scores could support a more tribal primitivist lifestyle.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#e000e0;">Elitism</b> ( Elitism )<br/>
        Those with higher Elitism scores believe that the leader should belong to an elite that is seperated from the populance. They tend to trust the people less. They could support aristocracy.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#75c025;">Populism</b> ( Elitism )<br/>
        Those with higher Populism scores believe that the government should win people's support in order to get power. Examples are the 2010's right-wing populist shock in Europe, Brazil and North America.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#c05050;">Disunity</b> ( Unity )<br/>
        </p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00c000;">Right Unity</b> ( Unity )<br/>
        </p>
